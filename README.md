# Mock-sign-up-form

My take on the sign-up form project provided by The Odin Project. I personalized the design to suit my interest, but the general layout is the same as the example provided for the project. Lorem text should be replaced but I'll leave it as is right now due to lack of creativity :D (for fun it would probably some sort of call to action within the context of the gundam universe)

Overall, I would say it was more tedious than it was difficult. I mainly just focused on one aspect at a time and played around with the CSS until I got it right or close enough. Postioning and getting the contents to be an appropriate size was the hardest part in my opinion and this page isn't even fully responsive yet. The validation is just for looks as we don't have anything beyond an index.html and css file. 

There are some minor things that could be improved. We may come back to this and polish it in the future, but for now, we will move on and learn more things that we could impliment later down the line.
